# My chess coding adventure
To practice working with .NET and C# I've decided to play around implementing the game of ches in unity.

## Base project
All of the initial commit is the implementation from the [unity tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXV-vjyZiT4b7WGjgiqMy422AVyMaigl1) on youtube, with its own [github repository](https://github.com/etredal/Chess_App).
